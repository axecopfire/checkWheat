      p I was really sad one day. I thought I would make a game. I would try and make it fun. I would invite my family and friends to play it. While coding I would chuckle to myself when I came up with a fun puzzle. I thought to myself that maybe someone may look at the challenge and have a real fun time thinking through it. 
      p Who really takes the time to read the copy though? Who takes time to really read the book? Don't get me wrong, I've read books. But I don't know if I have ever had a conversation with a book. I don't know if I know anymore about Poe now than I did before. I couldn't walk up to the man and pretend I know any of the darkness.
      p The clouds obscured the sun today. Its insanity how long its been since I've put my hand to pen and paper. Am I being productive? Is this really a reason to keep moving forward? Or should I just stop and toss and turn trying to go to sleep.

      p We haven't quite figured that out yet. If you can think of a good way please let us know.
      br
      h4 What's the goal of the game?
      p It's less a game and more of an experience. Life is a game. This is an escape.
      br

      p Oh for sure. It has its own website and everything.
      br
      h4 How do I get in touch with the author of this drivel?
      p Last I checked the email server went down. If it ever comes back up we will put an answer here or in the footer next to the copyright.
