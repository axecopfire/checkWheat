I thought I would make a game. I would try and make it fun. I would invite my family and friends to play it. While coding I would chuckle to myself when I came up with a fun puzzle. I thought to myself that maybe someone may look at the challenge and have a real fun time thinking through it. </p><p>Who really takes the time to read the copy though? Who takes time to really read the book? Don't get me wrong, I've read books. But I don't know if I have ever had a conversation with a book. I don't know if I know anymore about Poe now than I did before. I couldn't walk up to the man and pretend I know any of the darkness.</p><p>The clouds obscured the sun today. Its insanity how long its been since I've put my hand to pen and paper. Am I being productive? Is this really a reason to keep moving forward? Or should I just stop and toss and turn trying to go to sleep.</p></section><section class="nes-container with-title"><h3 class="title">F.A.Q.</h3><h4>How does one play checkWheat?</h4><p>We haven't quite figured that out yet. If you can think of a good way please let us know.</p><br><h4>What's the goal of the game?</h4><p>It's less a game and more of an experience. Life is a game. This is an escape.</p><br><h4>Is this really an actual thing?</h4><p>Oh for sure. It has its own website and everything.</p><br><h4>How do I get in touch with the author of this drivel?</h4><p>Last I checked the email server went down. If it ever comes back up we will put an answer here or in the footer next to the copyright.</p><br><h4>How many users are there playing this game?</h4><p>That information is personal. We don't like to share any information about us, our players. GDPR and all. Its the way the world works now you better get used to it you little snoop.</p><br></section><section class="nes-container with-title is-centered"><p class="title">Contact us</p><button class="nes-btn is-primary" type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('dialog-default').showModal();">Email us</button><dialog class="nes-dialog" id="dialog-default"><form method="dialog"><p class="title">Under construction</p><p>We seem to be unable to handle your request...Hmm that's weird</p><menu class="dialog-menu"><button class="nes-btn">Cancel</button></menu></form></dialog></section></main><footer id="footer"><p>Copyright (c)</p></footer><script src="/main.8f75cf09.js"></script></body></html>
